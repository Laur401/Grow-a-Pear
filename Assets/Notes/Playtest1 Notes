Bigger player should move slower and jump lower
Smaller player should move faster and jump higher

Balance level design

Artwork of players doesn't match the environment (replace environment)
Create animations for the characters (and maybe the environment)
Fix jumping collision, detection on slopes and moving objects
Fix 'cheesing' possibilities - jumping off walls, clipping between gates

Positives - good core mechanic, great player artwork
